# tensorflow_stuff
Mix of (well-known) tensorflow tutorials along with my own implementations

This repository contains well-known tensorflow tutorials (linear/logistic regression, MLP, CNN, CAE,...) along 
with some of my own implementations (ResNet only so far). Such implementations are trained/tested on the MNIST dataset 
for computational purpose.

This repository does not aim at providing state-of-the-art architectures (CNN, ResNet) but rather simple examples showing
how to implement the basic idea of such architectures.
