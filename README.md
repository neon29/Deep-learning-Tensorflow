# tensorflow_stuff
Mix of Deep learning algorithms implementation using the Tensorflow library.

This repository contains well-known tensorflow tutorials (linear/logistic regression, MLP, CNN, CAE,...) along 
with some of my own implementations (ResNet, DCGAN, conditional-DCGAN). Such implementations are trained/tested on the MNIST dataset for computational purpose.

This repository does not aim at providing state-of-the-art architectures (CNN, ResNet) but rather simple examples showing
how to implement the basic idea of such architectures.
